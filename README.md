for your interviews.

## Contributing

Fork and/or clone this repo.

To contribute a question that you have received in a real interview or that you
think would be good to add to the questions list, edit 
[questions.json](https://github.com/linterview-project/service/blob/main/questions.json).
Create a new entry following the template below. Suggest a short title for the question,
the full question in its entirety, an optional short description (it could include
where you heard the question or what skills the question focuses on).

```js
{
  "title": "Biggest Challenge",
  "question": "What has been the biggest challenge outside of work and school for you?",
  "description": "This question focuses on personality. I was asked this question
    when I interviewed for a internship position at LinterView."
}
```

Note that the description field is optional, and may be left blank.
